# Dependencies

This implementation was tested using `gcc version 14.2.1 20240910`, but it may work on other gcc versions, and possibly even with other compilers, since no compiler-specific features were used

# How to compile

```
gcc lambda-core.c -std=c99 -o output-lambda-core-c
```

You can replace "output-lambda-core-c" with any path where you want the output executable to be located after the compilation
